The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is an object detection algorithm that divides an  image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. YOLO is  known for its speed and efficiency as it processes the entire image in a single forward pass  through the neural network.
